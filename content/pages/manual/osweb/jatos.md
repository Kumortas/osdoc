## How can I get access to a JATOS server?

There is not a single JATOS server. Rather, different organizations and people have installed JATOS onto their own servers.


For testing purposes:

- You can use the [JATOS test server](https://www.jatos.org/JATOS-Tryout-Server.html) (%FigJatos1). The JATOS test server is reset every night, so you cannot use it for data collection!


For data collection:

- You can set up your own JATOS server, or use a JATOS server that is provided by your institution
- Or you can also make use of <https://mindprobe.eu/>, a free JATOS server sponsored by ESCoP and OpenSesame.
