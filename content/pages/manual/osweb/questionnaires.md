title: Questionnaires in OSWeb


OSWeb does not support forms. You can implement basic questionnaires using a combination of SKETCHPAD and MOUSE_RESPONSE items, but this is not very convenient.

As an alternative, you can implement a questionnaire using another platform, such as [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/), and then link to this questionnaire from your OSWeb experiment. The video below shows how to do this in such a way that you can tell afterwards which questionnaire data belongs to which OSWeb data.
