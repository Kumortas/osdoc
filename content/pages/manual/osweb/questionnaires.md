title: Questionnaires in OSWeb


## Forms and custom HTML

Forms and custom HTML are supported as of OSWeb 1.4
{:.page-notification}

You can use the form plugins as described here:

- %link:manual/forms/about%

The FORM_BASE plugin is *not* supported in OSWeb. Instead, you can use the INLINE_HTML item to implement custom HTML forms, as described here:

- %link:manual/forms/html%


## Linking to a different platform

As an alternative, you can implement a questionnaire using another platform, such as [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/), and then link to this questionnaire from your OSWeb experiment. The video below shows how to do this in such a way that you can tell afterwards which questionnaire data belongs to which OSWeb data.
