title: Sona Systems


Sona Systems is an online tool that many universities use for recruiting participants, granting course credit to student participants, etc. There is currently no direct way to integrate OSWeb with Sona Systems such that credits are automatically granted when a participant finishes the study. (We're working on this, and the documentation will be updated as soon as a solution is in place.) For now, the best options is to create a General Multiple Worker link in JATOS (see above), and have participants enter their student or Sona ID (or some other identifying feature) at the start of the experiment (see [this forum post](https://forum.cogsci.nl/discussion/5876/)).
