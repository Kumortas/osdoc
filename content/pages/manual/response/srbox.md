[TOC]

## About the srbox plugin

The serial response (SR) box is a button box, specifically designed for response collection in psychological experiments. The original version, developed by Psychology Software Tools, has 5 buttons, 5 lights, and is connected to the PC trough the serial port. There are also SR Box compatible devices by other manufacturers, which may differ in the number of buttons and lights and often use a USB connection, which emulates a serial port.

The SRBOX plugin for OpenSesame allows you to use the SR Box or compatible device in your OpenSesame experiments.

## Setting the device name

By default, the plugin tries to autodetect your SR Box. If this works, you don't have to change it. If your experiment freezes, OpenSesame has chosen the wrong serial port and you must enter the device name manually. Under Windows, the device is probably called something like

```text
COM4
```

Under Linux the device is probably called something like

```text
/dev/tty0
```

## Requirements

## Using the SR Box from Python inline code

The `srbox` object does *not* exist when the plug-in is in dummy mode.
